            <h3> Description</h3>
            <img src="images/ex3.png" id="logo">
            <p>Our aim is to create both tangible and digital product for a game for kids. We modify the game to be a hybrid of Scavenger Hunt and Treasure Hunt. Kids will need to find a hidden physical magnet based on the given hints.</p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>On the basis of Treasure hunt, the game master is responsible to hide all the tiny magnets, and similar to Scavenger hunt, the game master needs to provide clues for players to find the magnets. When the game is started, the players need to find the magnets and attach to the base. As magnet is attached to the base, the speaker on the base will tell the clue for the next magnet. Before the clue is given, the LED light on the side will light up for 3 second.</p>
