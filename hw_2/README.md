# Documentation

At first I tried to follow the instruction to create scroll event with linear gradient. Then I add on to the app.js the change in cordinate so that the bus can move along as we scroll down. I have attempted to adjust the cordinate a bit since the bus will go out of the screen but I was unable to fixed it unfortunately. Then I adjusted the position and the sizes of the bus by using percentage instead of pixels to maintain the ratio when the screen size change.

I then added on the bus stations which will be space evenly horizontally. I added the interactivity of the bustation which is hovering. By using the command "mouseenter" and "mouseleave", I changed the opacity of the words to make it become visible when the mouse enter the image. However, I struggle a lot when getting the element from the html and the console kept returning not finding element "stlyle". The way I fixed it was getting the element when applying the style directly.

The final one that I did is adding a button to change the background. Since I used linear gradient, I used the command bakground instead of backgroundColor. Also, the sae problem as before, I cannot take out the body to use even though I had called the variable before. I tried to fixed multiple times but I did not see any problem with it. I did managed to make it work but I still want to know what was wrong.
