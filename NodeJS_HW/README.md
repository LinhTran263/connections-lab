#NodeJS Assignment

<p> I reused my codes from Homework 2 and create a aserver with API for it. At first I have some trouble with fetching the API, the app.js file kept fetch data from the html file istead of the API. Then, it took me a whie to realize that I need a page for the API before fetching it.<br>
  Using the skills from the previous projects, I managed to display the data without any problem. Just a minor thought, when I use the params to fetch data, I do think that this is similar o the query. The only different is that the parameter is taken directly from the index.js file. However, I just wondering what are the advantages of using params over query?
