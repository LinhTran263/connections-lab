<h1>NodeJS Assignment</h1>

<p> I reused my codes from Homework 2 and create a aserver with API for it. At first I have some trouble with fetching the API, the app.js file kept fetch data from the html file istead of the API. Then, it took me a whie to realize that I need a page for the API before fetching it.</p>
<p>Next, I created an input box that will give me the values that I can latter access the details of the json data later on. Using the skills from the previous projects, I managed to display the data without any problem. Just a minor thought, when I use the params to fetch data, I do think that this is similar o the query. The only different is that the parameter is taken directly from the index.js file. However, I just wondering what are the advantages of using params over query?

<p> I created a div to display all of the information from the json files. I had some problems when tryng to take the x and y coordinates of certain object. However, I managed to use something else instead. Lastl, I made the screen to scroll so that the bus will stop at the station that was entered by the users.</p>
