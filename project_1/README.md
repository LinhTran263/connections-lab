<h1> Zodiac signs </h1>
<h2> Initial Ideas </h2>
<p>By using API from RapidAPI, I found an API about astrology. This will inclue information about different zodiac signs as well as quote of the day.
The user interaction I am intending to include is for the users to input the zodiac sign of their choice and the screen will display the information. Besides the data of the zodiac signs, I am going to use p5.j to draw the shape of the stars and it will move accordingly as the zodiac signs change. 
<p>The second interaction is that there will be calendar that allow the the users to easier navigate the information in around 3 days since the API only have data for "yesterday", "today", and "tomorrow". Also, I will randomly pick a quote of a day in the zodiac signs' quotes to display on the calendar.</p>

<h2> First attempt </h2>
<p>I created an initial version of the website. In the website, I currently only included the input box which allow me extract the desired data from the API. The information can be seen in the console since I want to try the p5.js first to observe how things would organize.</p>
