<h1> Zodiac signs </h1>
<h2> Initial Ideas </h2>
<p>By using API from RapidAPI, I found an API about astrology. This will inclue information about different zodiac signs as well as quote of the day.
The user interaction I am intending to include is for the users to input the zodiac sign of their choice and the screen will display the information. Besides the data of the zodiac signs, I am going to use p5.j to draw the shape of the stars and it will move accordingly as the zodiac signs change. 
<p>The second interaction is that there will be calendar that allow the the users to easier navigate the information in around 3 days since the API only have data for "yesterday", "today", and "tomorrow". Also, I will randomly pick a quote of a day in the zodiac signs' quotes to display on the calendar.</p>

<h2> Ideas and Implementation </h2>
<p><b>First Ideas:</b> I will draw the constellations of the zodiac signs by p5.js. However, I cannot find any API that have the data of the constellations. Furthermore, I realized that if I can find one, it will not fit to my webpage since the the scales of the website are different.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> I used the images of constellations on the Internet. Before adding the images to my website, I removed all of the background and uncessary details. Then I tried to make the images to appear randomly on the webpage without any overlay. However, I failed to make it not to be overlay (solution will be propsed at the end)</p>

<p><b>Second Ideas:</b> I planned to use the p5.js to draw the stars, that will appear randomly on the screen and when it is hover, iformation that is stored will appear on the screen. owever, after a few attempts, I decided to not use it since it does not match with what I wanted.</p>
